# BornDigitalAlignedXlations

This is a working directory for processing born-digital aligned translations.

The iteration includes:

* odyssey5-eng1.txt -- the source text for Odyssey 5 with in-line alignments produced by Amelia Parrish and Gregory Crane
* odyssey5-engtok.txt -- unique identifiers for each English token
* odyssey5-grctok.txt -- unique identifiers for each Greek token (based on the Treebanks [https://github.com/gregorycrane/gAGDT/tree/master/data/xml](here)
* odyssey5-aligns.tsv -- alignments based on the unique Greek and English tokens. This includes a prefix field that helpsif you want to create flash cards but can be ignored in most alignment situations.
* odyssey5-gloss.tsv -- glosses for almost every token in the Greek based on the alignments and with prefix pronouns etc added to make the glosses more self-standing. 


These glosses can be added to the treebank view:

The glosses we have now are based on a dictionary (Helma's?) and are general. We might say "Dictionary Gloss" and "Contextual Gloss" or something similar.
